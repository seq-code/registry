<h2>Apply for contributor status</h2>
<p class="lead">
  Please state below the reasons for your application as a contributor to the
  <b>SeqCode Registry</b> and any additional information and/or relevant
  qualifications. Our administrators will evaluate your application and grant or
  reject the status change promptly.
  <br/><br/>
  Make sure to indicate your expected contributions (<i>e.g.</i>, new names,
  reporting publications, editing or curating existing entries) and the status
  of these contributions (<i>e.g.</i>, manuscript in preparation, under review,
  published material). This is primarily a measure to combat spam, not an
  evaluation of academic merit.
