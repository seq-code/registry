<% name_s = @register.names.count == 1 ? 'name' : 'names' %>
<% case @action.to_s %>
<% when 'submit' %>
  You have successfully submitted the register list
  <%= @register.acc_url %>

  What does this mean?
  ====================
  Our team of curators have received your submission and will process it as
  soon as possible.

  What to do next?
  ================
  No actions are needed from your side at the moment.
<% when 'notify' %>
  You have successfully notified the SeqCode Registry of effective publication
  for the register list <%= @register.acc_url %>

  What does this mean?
  ====================
  Our team of curators have received your notification and will process it as
  soon as possible.

  What to do next?
  ================
  No actions are needed from your side at the moment.
<% when 'endorse' %>
  The register list <%= @register.acc_url %> has been endorsed.
  
  What does this mean?
  ====================
  Our team of curators have marked this list and all the included names and
  their associated metadata as suitable for validation. However, names are not
  valid (and do not have priority) until they have been published and the
  Registry is notified of publication.

  What to do next?
  ================
  If you are currently writing the manuscript that describes these taxa,
  undergoing peer-review, or the manuscript is currently in press, please
  remember to notify the SeqCode registry once the paper has been published.

  If the paper has already been published and a DOI has been assigned, please
  notify the SeqCode Registry at:
  <%= notify_register_url(@register) %>
<% when 'validate' %>
  The register list <%= @register.acc_url %> has been validated.

  What does this mean?
  ====================
  All the names in this list are now considered valid under the SeqCode. The
  exact priority date for all included names is: <%= @register.priority_date %>.

  What to do next?
  ================
  You can now cite the registration list using the assigned DOI:
  <%= @register.doi_url %>
  (it may take a few days before the DOI is properly registered).
  
  You can also cite the <%= name_s %> without quotation marks now. The formal
  recommended styling for the included <%= name_s %> is:
  <% @register.names.each do |name| %>
    - <%= name.formal_txt %>
  <% end %>
<% when 'return' %>
  The register list <%= @register.acc_url %> has been returned to you.

  What does this mean?
  ====================
  Our team of curators have identified at least one blocking issue with your
  list, and have returned it to you for inspection.

  What to do next?
  ================
  Please visit the register list page and revise the correspondence with
  curators to identify the next steps. Visit the register list page at:
  <%= @register.acc_url(true) %>

  <% unless @register.notes.empty? %>
  System and curator notes
  ========================
  <%= @register.notes.body.to_plain_text %>
  <% end %>
<% when 'transfer' %>
  The register list <%= @register.acc_url %> has been transferred
  to a different user.

  What does this mean?
  ====================
  You are no longer authorized to modify this list's data and metadata.

  What to do next?
  ================
  If you were aware and agree with this, you don't need to take any further
  actions. If you think this was a mistake, please contact us at:
