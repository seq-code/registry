<% name_s = @register.names.count == 1 ? 'name' : 'names' %>
<% case @action %>
<% when 'approve' %>
  The register list <%= @register.acc_url %> has been approved.
  
  What does this mean?
  ====================
  Our team of curators have marked this list and all the included names and
  their associated metadata as suitable for validation. However, names are not
  valid (and do not have priority) until they have been published and the
  Registry is notified of publication.

  What to do next?
  ================
  If you are currently writing the manuscript that describes these taxa,
  undergoing peer-review, or the manuscript is currently in press, please
  remember to notify the SeqCode registry once the paper has been published.

  If the paper has already been published and a DOI has been assigned, please
  notify the SeqCode Registry at:
  <%= notification_register_url(@register) %>
<% when 'validate' %>
  The register list <%= @register.acc_url %> has been validated.

  What does this mean?
  ====================
  All the names in this list are now considered valid under the SeqCode. The
  exact priority date for all included names is: <%= @register.priority_date %>.

  What to do next?
  ================
  You can now cite the registration list using the assigned DOI:
  <%= @register.doi_url %>
  (it may take a few days before the DOI is properly registered).
  
  You can also cite the <%= name_s %> without quotation marks now. The formal
  recommended styling for the included <%= name_s %> is:
  <% @register.names.each do |name| %>
    - <%= name.formal_txt %>
  <% end %>
<% when 'return' %>
  The register list <%= @register.acc_url %> has been returned to you.

  What does this mean?
  ====================
  Our team of curators have identified at least one blocking issue with your
  list, and have returned it to you for inspection.

  What to do next?
  ================
  Please visit the register list page and revise the correspondence with
  curators to identify the next steps. Visit the register list page at:
  <%= @register.acc_url(true) %>
